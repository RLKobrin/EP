	<p>I designed this robot for the FIRST Tech Challenge game Skystone. The robot features a drive base of mecanum wheels with belted 
	power transmission for omnidirectional movement as well as a pocketed aluminum chassis for weight reduction. The intent of the game was to 
	pick up and stack lego-like pieces. For this, wheels were used to pull blocks into the robot before a system of strung linear slides raised the 
	block to the appropriate height. The block was then shifted outside of the robot by a virtual four-bar linkage before being deposited in the correct
	location. The robot won the <strong>North Carolina State Championship Design Award</strong></p>

	<p>This is a peristaltic pump CAD design created for the BME298 Sophomore Design CAD Showcase. The intent of the showcase was to create a CAD model
	of a device that has a biomedical purpose. Peristaltic pumps can produce a constant rate flow of different liquids, giving them a variety of biomedical
	applications. The design won <strong>first place</strong> in the sophomore class from a panel of ten industry and academia judges. </p>

	<p>This is a robot designed for a FIRST Tech Challenge CADathon design competition. The design features a complex, belt-driven series of rollers and wheels
	used to carry game elements up the side of the robot into the central compartment, where a simple conveyor belt system allows them to be deposited elsewhere. 
	The rollers deploy and retract synchronously due to a motor-driven linkage at the back of the robot.</p>

	<p>This is a robot mechanism designed for a FIRST Robotics Competition CADathon design competition. Designed to shoot footballs, the mechanism features two
	staggered wheels in order to achieve a perfect spiral on a ball. The shooter sits atop a belt-driven slew bearing, allowing for full rotation to maximize
	potential shot locations.</p>
