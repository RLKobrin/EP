	<h2>Biomechanics</h2>
		<p><strong>BME345 Biomedical Solid Mechanics</strong></p>
		<p>Biomedical Solid Mechanics built upon the foundation of BME205 Intro to Biomedical Mechanics by introducing non-static systems. The class focused
		   on both solids and dynamics, with topics including kinematics, kinetics, finite element analysis, and strain/stress transformations. Class projects
	 	   included the construction of a MATLAB model of the forces and kinetics of a biker (found in the Code section).</p>
		<p>Skills: MATLAB, Kinetics, Kinematics, FEA, Solids</p>
			
		<p><strong>BME205 Intro to Biomedical Mechanics</strong></p>
		<p>Intro to Biomedical Mechanics provided foundation-level knowledge of static mechanics in a biomechanics environment. I learned statics through weekly
		   lectures and practice problems. I then had the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a practical manner through weekly hands-on labs determining
		   the mechanics of motion of different body parts</p>
		<p>Skills: Static Mechanics, MATLAB, Ansys FEA</p>
	
	<h2>Biomaterials</h2>
		<p><strong>BME335 Biomaterials</strong></p>
		<p>Biomaterials built upon the foundation of BME209 through weekly literature reviews and lectures on current biomaterials trends and applications.
		   Intended to be an introduction to the world of applied biomaterials, the course provided an overview of current research in hydrogels, tissue
		engineering, and more.</p>
		<p>Skills: Research Paper Analysis</p>
	
	<h2>Electronics</h2>
		<p><strong>BME207 BME Electronics</strong></p>
		<p>Biomedical Electronics provided the foundational knowledge for the circuitry and electronics needed for basic biomedical devices. The course consisted
		   of lectures suplemented by a weekly hands-on lab utilizing an Arduino kit.</p>
		<p>Skills: Arduino, Circuit Simplification, Op-Amps, Logic Gates</p>
	
	<h2>Biomedical Engineering Special</h2>
		<p><strong>BME298 Biomedical Design and Manufacturing 1</strong></p>
		<p>Design and Manufacturing 1, known as Sophomore Design, included modules on CAD, Arduino, and Microbiology. In the CAD module, I created four 
		   CAD designs culminating in the Sophomore Design CAD Showcase. My showcase project, which won first place from a panel of industry judges, can
		   be found in the CAD section. During the Arduino section, I worked with a breadboard and arduino kit in order to accomplish a series of projects
		   using sensors, motors, and more. In the microbiology module, I completed an experiment testing the antibacterial properties of different 
		   nanoparticles against E.coli.</p>
		<p>Skills: SolidWorks, Arduino, Microbiological Culture</p>
			
		<p><strong>BME295 Research in Biomedical Engineering for Undergraduates</strong></p>
		<p>Research in Biomedical Engineering for Undergraduates allowed me to recieve academic credit for my research conducted in the ImmunoEngineering
		   lab under Dr. David Zaharoff. The research and final report can be found in the Research section.</p>
		<p>Skills: Animal Cell Culture, Hydrogel Creation, Lab Safety</p>
